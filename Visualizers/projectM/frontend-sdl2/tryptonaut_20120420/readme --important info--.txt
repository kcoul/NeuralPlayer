--------------------------- i. Installation ---------------------------



1. Backup and delete all files in your Milkdrop2 Preset folder.
Ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\Winamp\Plugins\Milkdrop2\presets


2. Copy the contents from this zip to the path of your Milkdrop2  folder. If prompted to replace files/conflicts choose Yes to all.

Ex: C:\Program Files (x86)\Winamp\Plugins\Milkdrop2

3. Reload Winamp or whatever application you were running Milkdrop2 on. Launch Milkdrop and enjoy! (keep reading, there is a lot more to this to optimize the visuals)

4. If you are running Foobar2000, install the Shpeck addon to have greater preset compatibility. Some presets will still not work, but you can always remove or rate down incompatible .milks. The latest versions of Winamp are recommended to guarantee 100% compatibility with this pack.


--------------------- ii. Milkdrop Settings -----------------------



1. In your media player preferences load up the Milkdrop config. 
Ex: Winamp > Preferences > Plug-ins > Milkdrop > Configure

2. If your computer is fast set the max-framerate to 30 with "allow page tearing" disabled. Page tearing is related to vsync and for visuals you want it off for a smooth experience.

3. Click the "More Settings" tab. You absolutely must uncheck "Disable preset rating". If you do not do this, your overall experience will be dramatically reduced. I will go more into the details of why in section iii.

4. Click the "transitions" tab. Insure that "Disable hard cuts" is selected.



---------------------- iii. Important Notes ------------------------



1. Depending on the music you are listening to Milkdrop may or may not optimally render a visual to your satisfaction. Some visuals look better with slow music, some with faster. This preset pack attempts to bridge that gap but anomalies may occur.

Some visuals also look better at different screen resolutions. This pack was tested at 1920x1080.

2. You can further customize this preset pack while running Winamp. Presets are rated from 0 to 5. A rating of 0 means a preset will never be shown, and 5 means the visual will have a higher odds of being randomly selected.

To see what a preset's rating is press F6 when milkdrop is the active window. To alter this rating press the + or - keys.

I've removed all of my '0' rated .milks from this pack, but there are lots of 1's and 2's because you need to have low rated presets for the better looking (4-5 rated) visuals to be displayed the most.

3. When in milkdrop, press spacebar to go forward to the next visual, and backspace to go back. Every time you load up milkdrop it randomly chooses different visuals.

4. If for some reason a preset will give you a texture error, vote down the preset to 0 by pressing -. The next time you launch milkdrop it will not try to load it again as long as you have "Disable preset rating" unchecked in Milkdrop's settings.

5. This is merely a super-customized pack of handpicked-pre-made visuals. Each visuals' creator(s) are listed in the filename of each individual .milk file. Giving credit where it's due!

6. Please share and enjoy!
