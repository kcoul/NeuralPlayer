---------------------- iii. Important Notes ------------------------



1. The contents of this folder will change frequently and abruptly in conjunction with NeuralVisualizer R&D work on visualizer<num> named branches. If you are following and you like some results copy the presets to another Presets+Textures folder structure in a differently named parent folder on your fork! Follow the example in Paths.h and the many Preset+Texture banks in the frontend-sdl2 directory to extend the Visualizer to your custom bank!

2. The current workbench in this folder tracks the community contributions in the first link off of
