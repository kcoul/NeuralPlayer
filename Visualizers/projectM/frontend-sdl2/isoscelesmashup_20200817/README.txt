Unzip the ZIP Archive
==============================
If you are using Windows 7 then please beware of using the default unzip tool of Windows since it has been known to not fully unzip ZIP archives containing many thousands of files. Better to use PeaZip instead.



Install the Presets Collection
==============================
Copy the contents of the Presets folder into:
NestDrop/Plugins/Milkdrop2/Presets

Copy the contents of the Textures folder into:
NestDrop/Plugins/Milkdrop2/Textures



Preset Organization & Preview Images
==============================
The presets have been organized into categories and subcategories folders. The organizational structure matches that of the Cream of the Crop collection, so both collections can be installed into NestDrop and they will seamlessly merge together.

NestDrop is able to read this folder architecture and keep the presets organized in the same manner.

Preview images are included for each preset. These previews are automatically utilized by NestDrop.



What is NestDrop?
==============================
NestDrop is a tool for performing with high-resolution high-fps generative visuals which react in real-time to the music and then broadcasts the video via Spout. Since the Milkdrop engine is at the core you can easily bring in your own presets. Use any audio source to drive the visuals, even live audio.
