Unzip the ZIP Archive
==============================
If you are using Windows 7 then please beware of using the default unzip tool of Windows since it has been known to not fully unzip ZIP archives containing many thousands of files. Better to use PeaZip instead.

Within this ZIP archive there are some very long filenames. So if you're trying to extract the files to your desktop, then you might reach the max path length that Windows can allow for. If you experience issues during extraction, then instead try extracting it to your hard drive root <C:\>. But if it extracts without any error prompts then you're good to go.



Install the Presets Collection
==============================
Copy the contents of the Presets folder into:
NestDrop/Plugins/Milkdrop2/Presets

Copy the contents of the Textures folder into:
NestDrop/Plugins/Milkdrop2/Textures



User Profile
==============================
Also included is an optional XML file. After installing the presets, if you load this user profile into NestDrop then you will see certain presets marked as favorites. These are the presets which are bundled along with NestDrop (as of 2020-02-16). I also curated the presets for the default NestDrop bundle, so all of those presets are also contained within this collection.

The default location for user profile XML files is within the root NestDrop folder.



Preset Organization & Preview Images
==============================
All of the presets are organized into main category folders and nested subcategory folders. NestDrop is able to read this folder architecture and keep the presets organized in the same manner.

Preview images are included for each preset. These previews are automatically utilized by NestDrop.



What is NestDrop?
==============================
NestDrop is a tool for performing with high-resolution high-fps generative visuals which react in real-time to the music and then broadcasts the video via Spout. Since the Milkdrop engine is at the core you can easily bring in your own presets. Use any audio source to drive the visuals, even live audio.
