### Application window settings

# If set to true, the application will start in fullscreen mode

# 0 will use system defaults for placement, 1 and above select a specific monitor.
# If the number is too large, that last available monitor is used.

# Two fullscreen modes are supported:
# - windowed: Uses a borderless window, filling the current monitor.
#             Does not change the current resolution.
# - exclusive: Sets the resolution to window.fullscreen.width/height and runs in exclusive mode,
#              like a game.
window.fullscreen.exclusiveMode = false

# Only used if fullscreen mode is "exclusive"
# If any value is set to 0, the nearest available fullscreen resolution for the current window size is used.

### projectM settings

# Per-pixel mesh size. This is the grid in which "per-pixel" code is executed, once per cell.
# Do net set this value too high, as it severely impacts performance. On low-end hardware, set this to a smal
# value, e.g. 64x32. This does *NOT* affect the actual render/shader resolution!
projectM.meshX = 200

### Logging settings

# For detailed information on how to configure logging, please refer to the POCO documentation:
# https://docs.pocoproject.org/current/Poco.Util.LoggingConfigurator.html

### Logging configuration

# Verbose log format, includes process/thread ID, source etc.

# The "times" property can be either set to "local" (default) or "UTC".

# Simple log format, only date/time and the message
logging.formatters.simple.class = PatternFormatter
logging.formatters.simple.pattern = %Y-%m-%dT%h:%M:%SZ %t
logging.formatters.simple.times = local

# Default file log, creates a new one if it reaches 1 MiB and keeps a single old log.
# See https://docs.pocoproject.org/current/Poco.FileChannel.html for all possible options.

# You can configure log levels, channels etc. for each message source (logger) individually.
# See https://docs.pocoproject.org/current/Poco.Util.LoggingConfigurator.html for details.
# Example:
#     logging.loggers.AudioCapture.level = debug
